hash: 
    unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data

hash Algorithm
    a function that computes data into a unique hash

mining:
    the process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem"
    in our example, the "problem" was to find a hash that starts with four zeros
    nodes get paid for mining blocks

block:
    a list of transactions mined together

decentralized:
    having no single point of authority

nonce:
    a "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem
    it's also used to defined the transaction number for an account/address

私钥加签，公钥验签
private key:
    only known to the key holder, is's used to "sign" transactions

public key:
    is derived from your private key
    anyone can "see" it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from you

signing a transaction:
    a "one way" process
    someone with a private key signs a transaction by their private key being hashed with their transactions data
    anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key

private key ||| > public key > address

node:
    a single instance in a decentralized network

blockchains are resilient

链选择算法
    chain selection
公民抵抗机制
    sybil resistance
        * poW: proof of Work （防止攻击，耗电大）
            miners
            ETH & BTC
        * poS: proof of Stake (耗电小)
            poS nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism
            validators
            ETH2

consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain (mechanism: 方法）
    * Nakamoto Consensus : 中本协议
consensus is how blockchains decide what the state of the chain is

blockchain nodes keep lists of the transactions that occur

block confirmations

Sybil Attack
51% Attack

scalablity -> sharding

rollup

sharding and rollups are scalablity solutions on layer 1

gas prices are how much it costs to perform executions on-chain


-------------------

Smart Contracts have addresses just like our wallet accounts do
Any time you change something on-chain, including making a new contract, it happens in a transaction.

view and pure functions, when called alone, don't spend gas

只有更改区块链的状态才会需要消耗gas
if a gas calling function calls a view or pure function - only then will it cost gas

Blockchain Oracle: 
    Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.
